# testBasedGame

This is my text based game I made for my final project in a beginner to python computer science class. It includes the use of class, dictionaries, lists, and multiple variables to make the game work. The game so far inlcudes 2 full scenes, 2 dialogue trees, and 3 combat scenarios. The game has a built in tutorial for combat, and a tutorial for the dialogue. There are comments throughout the code that attempt to describe the functionality of what is being done and how. Things that are redundant or seemingly self explanitory were not commented on. 

To make sure the game runs as it is supposed to, make sure to keep all of the files within the same folder. To open the files, you will need some sort of application that can open a python file and allow you to run it. 

Upon running the consolatiaMain.py file, you should be able to play through the game. There is a programmed delay between every line, as to make it more redable and understandable

As of 11/28/2022, the scene three file is currently being worked on and is commented out on the main file.
